    \todo{Here, we will beat the analysis of this algorithm to death so that we can get a bound on the number of operations required to compute this estimate (we are talking about constants after all)}
    \subsection{Error Analysis}
      \todo{Here, we will bound (very tightly) the number of samples needed}
    \subsection{Runtime Analysis}
      \todo{Here, we will bound (very tightly) the number of operations per sample needed}
